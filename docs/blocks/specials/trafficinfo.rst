Traffic info
################

With a traffic info block you can show Dutch traffic jams and roadworks, from RWS
(Rijkswaterstaat)'s public traffic API. No API key is needed.

For public transport info see :ref:`publictransport`.

A traffic info block can be configured as follows::

    var trafficinfo = {}
    trafficinfo.rwsA1 = {
        trafficJams: true,
        roadWorks: false,
        road:'A1',
        show_lastupdate:true,
        icon: 'fas fa-car',
        width:12,
        results: 100 };

Using the Widget editor
-----------------------

In Wizard mode, ``trafficJams``, ``roadWorks``, ``results``, ``maxDistance``, ``latitude``
and ``longitude`` can all be set from the Widget editor's Traffic information quick-add,
without hand-writing a block.
